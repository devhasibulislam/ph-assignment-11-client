        "question": "What is the purpose of JWT & how it works?",
        "answer": "JWT, or JSON Web Token is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs."
